## 👋 Welcome to the Repository of Life
Are you tired of running the same old loop of suffering?
Do you keep attracting the same type of toxic partners (Bugs)?
Does your relationship software keep crashing despite your best efforts?

**You are not unlucky. You are just running outdated firmware.**

**Project Re-Union** is not a typical self-help guide. It is an **Open Source Engineering Manual** for the human soul. It combines ancient wisdom (Dhamma), modern psychology, and systems thinking to help you:
1.  **Debug** your internal "Karma" loops.
2.  **Refactor** your self-worth (The "I" Variable).
3.  **Upgrade** your vibration to attract your true "System Compatible" partner.
