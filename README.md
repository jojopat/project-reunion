# 🌍 Project Re-Union: The Universal Love Protocol
> *"Anger between lovers exists because love is still there. We just need to redefine what love means, and the whole world changes."* —  Pat Jojo Sadavongvivad (Project Founder & Author) Facebook Profile https://www.facebook.com/jojopat/ 

## 📖 About The Project
**Project Re-Union** is an open-source initiative dedicated to preserving families and healing relationships globally. We believe that relationship wisdom should be accessible to everyone, regardless of language, culture, or religion.

This repository hosts the source text of two profound Thai books:
1.  **The Cause of Love (เหตุเกิดจากความรัก)**
2.  **True Love & The Buddha's Parami (รักแท้และคู่บารมีของพระพุทธเจ้า)**

These texts have already helped numerous families reconcile—from couples separated for 8 years to those on the brink of divorce. Now, we aim to **"transcreate"** (translate + recreate) this wisdom into every major language, adapting the context to fit local cultures while keeping the core message intact.

## 🎯 Our Mission
To combine **Technology** and **Spiritual Science** to heal **1 million relationships** worldwide.
